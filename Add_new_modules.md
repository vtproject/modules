**How to add new modules to Visual Tracker**

You just have to choose the module in the download section. Download it and unzip the file. Inside you'll find a file “vt\_mymodule.pd” and a folder copy this folder in the abs folder of Visual Tracker (/visualtracker/abs/) and copy the “.pd” patch in Visual Tracker root folder (/visualtracker).

Once it's done you can load modules in VT by creating an object [vt\_mymodule](vt_mymodule.md) in the “loaded modules window”. A GOP (graph on parent) should appear as well as a canvas in the “composition timeline” window.
