1-Sometimes sound vanishes in some modules. Of course check your routings (is the master on? is the track on ? does it output to the right channel ? when you activate the VU does the level change ? if not is a synth on ? if yes is it thrown right to master or routed to effects ? does my effect produces sound ?) if none of those question helped you try to Test your audio and midi configuration in Media-> Test audio and midi; sometimes it will put the sound back. It seems to happen quite often with vt\_S-32...

2-Working with presets and two instances of the same module : when saving a preset, and saving the preset, if you save the module (to write the preset in the code) it will initialize others modules of the same type. Be sure to have all the presets you have been working on written in the preset popup window before pressing Ctrl+S to save your change to the module.
